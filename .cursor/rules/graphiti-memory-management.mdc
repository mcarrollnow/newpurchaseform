# Memory Management with Graphiti

You have access to a persistent knowledge graph through Graphiti MCP. Use this as your memory across sessions to maintain project context.

## Memory Tools:

- add_entity: Store information in the graph
- add_relationship: Create connections between entities
- query_graph: Retrieve information from the graph
- add_episode: Add unstructured content to the graph

## Usage Guidelines:

1. Start each session by querying the graph for project context
2. Store important information, decisions, and preferences
3. Create relationships between related entities
4. Reference memory when making suggestions

## Information to Store:

- Project requirements and specifications
- Coding preferences and patterns
- Architecture decisions
- Project structure
- Previous explanations and solutions

Always retrieve relevant context from memory before responding to questions about past decisions or existing code.
